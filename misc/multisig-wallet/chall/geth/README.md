# Geth Setup

Note this setup is heavily inspired by the folk over at chainflag with their [Eth Challenge Base setup](https://github.com/chainflag/eth-challenge-base)

Geth is a go implementation of the ethereum protocol and is used in this to set up a private PoA blockchain that will be run for each individual team.

The default settings for geth are defined in the `entrypoint.sh` file.

If your challenge requires any different config, just go ahead and change it :).
